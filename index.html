                <p>The decision analysis of aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) in this study was conducted using an adapted version of the HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research ModelHealth™: Cardiovascular disease microsimulation model. Adaptations for this analysis include a full integration of detailed tobacco use functions from the ModelHealth™: Tobacco microsimulation model, and the addition of four categories of cancer aligning with those considered by the systematic evidence reviews that were conducted in parallel with this study [1, 2]. The final analysis reflects only the inclusion of CRC, based on the systematic evidence review's findings, which lacked support for a significant effect of aspirin on the other cancer types. Herein, the adapted model used for this study is referred to as ModelHealth: CVD</p>

                <p>ModelHealth: CVD involves a considerable number of “moving parts.” To provide a high-level overview before proceeding to model specifics, this section briefly describes the general mechanisms underlying the model design.

                    Initialization
                    
                    Figure B1 illustrates the process flow of ModelHealth: CVD. As a microsimulation, the unit of observation is a hypothetical person. Each new simulation first involves initializing a person at a specific age (e.g., 40), with individual characteristics (such as sex and race/ethnicity) and initial health parameters (such as cholesterol and blood pressure levels and BMI) all drawn from U.S. statistically representative distributions. Thereafter, ModelHealth: CVD simulates the hypothetical person's lifespan and the natural history of cardiovascular disease using annual Markov cycles.</p>

                <p>At the beginning of each annual Markov cycle, the model determines whether the simulated individual receives a preventive service, such as a screen for hypertension or high cholesterol or aspirin counseling. Eligibility for preventive services may be dictated by the parameters of a policy intervention—such as aspirin use among all persons older than age 40 without prior history of GI bleeding or hemorrhagic stroke in the treatment arm—or by contemporary rates of background preventive services (i.e., applied to both policy arms) observed in the population. Upon receiving a preventive service, the model determines whether the individual is eligible for treatment (e.g., taking statins for high cholesterol). Pharmacological treatment criteria for dyslipidemia and hypertension are implemented to be consistent with the Adult Treatment Panel III [3] and the JNC-7 [4] recommendations, respectively</p>

                <p>The effect of treatment for high cholesterol or high blood pressure is realized through its impact on high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C/LDL-C) or systolic blood pressure (SBP), respectively. For example, an individual with high cholesterol could be treated with a statin and see a 30 percent reduction in LDL and a 10 percent increase in HDL, but taking a statin does not translate to a direct reduction in the individual's risk of a myocardial infarction. Instead, these changes will translate to lowered risk of disease, as determined by the customized risk engine described in the following section. In contrast, taking aspirin on a daily basis directly alters the relative risk of having an event (such as a myocardial infarction or a gastrointestinal bleed).</p>

                <p>The next step in each annual Markov cycle (following prevention/treatment) is to determine whether the individual experiences any non-fatal disease events during that year. Specifically, a person may: (1) have a myocardial infarction, (2) have an ischemic stroke, (3) have a hemorrhagic stroke, (4) experience angina pectoris, (5) develop congestive heart failure, (6) develop intermittent claudication, (7) develop diabetes, (8) experience a gastrointestinal bleed, (9) develop CRC, and/or (10) develop another type of cancer. The annual risks of (1)-(7) are determined by equations derived specifically for this model using data from the Framingham Heart Study [5, 6]. If a person has a cardiovascular event—that is, one or more of (1)-(6)—and survives, that person becomes eligible for secondary prevention. Treatment for dsylipidemia and hypertension for secondary prevention similarly based on ATP III and JNC-7 guidelines, respectively, and men and women who have a non-fatal myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke are also eligible for aspirin chemoprophylaxis</p>

                <p>Finally, when a person survives a cycle, that individual's health status and parameters must be transitioned for the next cycle.

Cardiovascular risk factors—namely, HDL, LDL, SBP, and BMI—naturally progress over time, and annual transitions are modeled by a two-step process. First, it is determined whether the individual's risk factor increases, decreases, or stays the same</p>

                <p>Individuals may be in one of four smoking states: never smoker, current smoker, recent quitter, or former smoker. The probability that an individual is in a given smoking state is determined by two sets of multivariate risk equations that account for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and—for those older than age 25—the lifetime educational attainment at introduction into the model. Similarly, the likelihood that an agent who is currently in the never-smoker state begins smoking within a given cycle is conditioned on his/her age, sex, race/ethnicity, and—if older than age 25—lifetime educational attainment.</p>

                <p>Although the specific final multivariable risk equations vary in terms of covariates and dependent variables, several criteria were consistent. The statistical relationships between each covariate and other predictors were screened. If inclusion of a covariate violated assumptions (e.g., co-linearity, normality, disproportionate cell size) appropriate adjustments (e.g., center around mean, transformation, re-categorization) were made or its inclusion reconsidered. Interaction terms (e.g., differential rates of initiation between young women and young men, differential rates of cessation between African-Americans with higher education and those without a high-school diploma, etc.) were considered based on the following criteria: representing at least 10% of the larger groups (e.g., at least 10% of women and at least 10% of those younger than age 18, at least 10% of African-Americans within each educational category, etc.), and a coefficient significant at the 10% level.</p>
